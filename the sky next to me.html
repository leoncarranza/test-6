    <h1>The Sky Next to Me</h1>
    <p>These two pieces were made over the summer of 2018. I started getting interested in the soothing shapes of clouds.
      In both pieces, there are vertically-lined poles. These represent the now-demolished abandoned golf poles that take up the view of the clouds by the river close to where I live.</p>
